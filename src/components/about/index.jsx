                    <p>Hello! My name is Andr√© Pacheco and I'm a software developer from Portugal, with a passion for web development.</p>
                    <p>I have a Bachelor's in Science (BSc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering, which combines the study of electrical engineering and computer science. The main subjects include courses in mathematics, physics, programming, electronics, instrumentation, automation, control, telecommunications, energy systems, and management.</p>
                    <p>Overall, this degree provided me with a strong foundation in the principles and practices of electrical and computer engineering and the ability to design, develop and apply electrical and electronic systems and devices, as well as computer systems and software.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I like to use my skills to create and maintain websites as well as web applications and I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in web development to maximize the potential of my projects. My aim is to deliver high-quality results with my problem-solving and analytical skills.</p>
